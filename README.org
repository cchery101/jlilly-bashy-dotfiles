* Dotfiles
These are dotfiles. A few things here or there I've picked up over the
years. I'm attempting to convert most of these files, as the need
strikes to do big updates to them, into literate programming. You can
read more about my setup on [[http://justinlilly.com/emacs/literate_programming.html][my website]].

As such, these are artifacts of a separate system. Updates will likely
come in large chunks and poorly commented via commits.
